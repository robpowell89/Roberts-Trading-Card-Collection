Welcome to my large collection of trading cards that ive collected in the last 20 years. It is wide ranging it inculdes Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh, and Sports cards called Roberts Trading Card Collection 
In this project over the last 3 months ive learned an lot of basic language such as HTML, CSS, and Javascirpt. Ive apply basic CSS with my project using the hamburger button whihc allows the webiste to be used in different settings such as an iphone,ipad,and basic desktop pc. It also has an grid system as well as flexbox was hard for me to understand so I went with an esaier option i hope to use flexbox in the future after this fall semster is over. I do have an basic javasciprt with the hamburger button.
