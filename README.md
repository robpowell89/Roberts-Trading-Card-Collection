Welcome to my large collection of trading cards that ive collected in the last 20 years. It is wide ranging it inculdes Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh, and Sports cards called Roberts Trading Card Collection 

Wanted to say my project is showing commits in the master and main branches as all my project work is in the master branch so wanted to state this so there is no confusion and i dont risk myself to fail the semester 

Project Overview: I'll highlight the three main features that is required by our mentors. In this project over the last 3 months ive learned an lot of basic language such as HTML, CSS, and Javascirpt. Ive apply basic CSS with my project using the hamburger button which allows the webiste to be used in different settings such as an iphone,ipad,and basic desktop pc. Ive also have used different media queries which is the main requirment as website can be viewed in different different levels. It also has an grid system that shows the card in an grid system which i learned from our vidoes. I do have an basic javasciprt with the hamburger button that allows the screen to collapse.

In the feature i hope to create new website and will change my current one as gain more skills and knowledge
